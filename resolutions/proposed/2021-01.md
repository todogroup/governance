# TODO Group Steering Committee
## Resolution 2021-01
## Status: Approved on 2021-11-17

## Subject: Clarify Steering Committee's responsibility to oversee business and marketing matters

On 2021-11-17, the Steering Committee of the TODO Group reviewed and approved the following resolution:

Amend section 3.a.ii to clarify the responsibility of the Steering Committee to oversee business and marketing matters.

3.a.ii Previous Language: overseeing all business and marketing matters;

3.a.ii Proposed Language: overseeing all business and marketing matters, including approving new programs and initiatives that make use of the TODO Group name, logo, or branding, and approving use of the TODO Group name, logo, or branding for sponsorship or endorsement purposes;

Resolved:

WHEREAS, the charter of the TODO Group, dated 2019-11-10, empowers the Steering Committee to "adopt and maintain policies, rules, and/or procedures for the group" (3.a.iv);

That the committee approves the proposed action.

## Vote Results

* Chris Aniszczyk - abstain/absent
* Kevin P. Fleming - approve
* Dawn Foster - approve
* Stephen Jacobs - abstain/absent
* Duane O'Brien - approve
* Stormy Peters - abstain/absent
* Ashley Wolf - approve

## Rationale

The existing language of 3.a.ii leaves room for interpretation when it comes to the Steering Committee’s responsibility to oversee business or marketing efforts conducted on behalf of the TODO Group. This has resulted in multiple instances of a new program or initiative being launched on behalf of the TODO Group without going through an oversight process. This amendment seeks to clarify the Steering Committee’s oversight responsibilities.
