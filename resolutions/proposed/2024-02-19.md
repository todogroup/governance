# TODO Group Steering Committee

## Resolution 2024-02

## Status: Proposed on 2024-02-13

## Subject: Clarify TODO Ambassador title when the individual moves to a different organization

The documentation on the Ambassador program page (https://todogroup.org/community/ambassadors/) does not specify what 
happens to the title of TODO Ambassador when the individual who holds such title moves to a different organization


Resolved:

WHEREAS, the Steering Committee determines that the TODO Ambassador title is granted to individuals regardless of their affiliation, and can maintain the ambassador benefits and responsibilities when moving to a different organization, if that person still wishes to serve as a TODO Ambassador,

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that the committee approves the proposed action.
