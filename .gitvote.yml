# Automation (optional)
#
# Create votes automatically on PRs when any of the files affected by the PR
# match any of the patterns provided. Patterns must follow the gitignore
# format (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).
#
# Each automation rule must include a list of patterns and the profile to use
# when creating the vote. This allows creating votes automatically using the
# desired configuration based on the patterns matched. Rules are processed in
#Â the order provided, and the first match wins.
