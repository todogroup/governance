## üß© About TODO structure

The [TODO structure folder](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/TODO%20Structure/structure-mindmap.md#todo-groups-structure) shares an overview of the TODO Group's structure, including existing communication channels, meetings, regional chapters and resources. A generated mind map screenshot has been added for better visualization of the different items.

TODO Group is formed by its *Community Participants* including *OSPO Associates* and *General Members*. TODO Group Community is open to all. Sometimes, there are community participants with an established OSPO or open source initiative who wish to support TODO by becoming a [General Member](https://todogroup.org/join/) and/or [OSPO Associate](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/OSPO-Associate-Program.md). Please see [TODO Group overview presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4dhx0Dg8fZDO8yzp7nWC2r5WHyVH-jjSQM59lkKLdo/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more.
