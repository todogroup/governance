# üèõ TODO Group Governance Repo


This repo was created  with the aim of helping community participants better understand how TODO operates:

## Mission and Decision-Making

In TODO, it is the community participants that shape the project initiatives. Community participants can include individual contributors to any of the TODO repositories, such as OSPOlogy, frequent attendees of TODO virtual or in-person meetings, OSPO Ambassadors building local chapters, or organizational representatives joining as General Members or Associates.

The Steering Committee (SC) holds a supporter role, providing scaffolding processes to help the community implement initiatives and keep them maintained in the long term. This includes establishing and maintaining operational processes that ensure continued progress and successful outcomes for both the project and its community.

    <strong>‚è∞ TODO Steering Committee Member Commitment Expectations </strong>
  </summary><br />

Steering Committee Members meet for a 1-hour Zoom call each month to review community proposals and address key discussion topics that require further attention. We ask that members attend at least three consecutive calls and actively contribute to the discussions.

In addition to the monthly calls, most of the Steering Committee‚Äôs work is conducted asynchronously via slack Pull Request Reviews and mailing list discussions. Each member has the flexibility to determine how much time they can dedicate to supporting the community‚Äôs efforts.

## Our Playbook - Operational Guidelines

The TODO Playbook is a practical guide designed to help community participants understand and navigate processes within the project. While the Charter gives a general overview of the project structure and governance, the Playbook covers the specific operational details that ensure smooth participation and collaboration. It includes guidelines on how the community participants can submit new proposals, where and how these proposals are discussed, and the processes for onboarding new members. Essentially, the Playbook serves as a hands-on resource for the community, outlining procedures that are not explicitly covered in the Charter, ensuring transparency and accessibility for all participants.

    <strong>üìö Process for Shutting Down Inactive Channels or Working Groups</strong>
  </summary><br />


This section outlines the procedure for managing and eventually shutting down inactive Slack channels, mailing lists, or working groups within 
the TODO and OSPOlogy groups. The goal is to ensure active engagement and efficient resource use across the community.

- Phase 1: No activity for 3 months in any Slack channel, mailing list, or working group.
    - Responsible: Project Manager (PM) monitors and identifies inactivity.
    - Action: PM sends a warning to inactive groups, asking for volunteers to re-engage, and notifies the Steering Committee for awareness.
    - Deadline: 2 weeks for volunteers to come forward.
- Phase 2: If no one volunteers within 2 weeks, PM sends a closure notification.
    - Action: PM archives all related materials and officially closes the group and notifies the Steering Committee for awareness.
    - Documentation: Record the process via the GH discussions for transparency.
